# 👨‍🎓About

I am a Junior student in the Division of Automation at South China University of Technology and I am a research intern under the supervision of [Prof. Yu Cheng](https://ych133.github.io/). My research interests focus on efficient learning and generative models in the fields of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing.

To study further, I am seeking an opportunity to intern at place I am interested in. If it does come, I will not waste it because I know it comes not easy. Besides, I also enjoy hiking, jogging and playing football a lot.

Please find my CV [here](../files/Resume_Hao.pdf "Hao Zhou's CV"){:target="_blank"}.
