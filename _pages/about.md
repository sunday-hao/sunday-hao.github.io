# 👨‍🎓About

**Hao Zhou** is a Sophomore student in the Division of Automation at South China University of Technology. My research interests broadly lie in computer vision and Efficient ML, Robotics. Recently I work on a project about Gait Recognition, Knowledge Distillation and Pruning.

Outside of my academic life, I enjoy hiking, jogging and playing football a lot. I grew up in Hengyang, a centuried city in Hunan province, China.
