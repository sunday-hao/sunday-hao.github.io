# Research Experience

## 1. Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory

Research Intern @ [OpenGVLab](https://github.com/OpenGVLab), 09/2024 - Present, ShangHai \
SuperVisor: [Prof. Yu Cheng](https://ych133.github.io/)

## 1. South China University of Technology

Intern, 09/2023 - 05/2024, Biometrics and Intelligence Perception Lab \
SuperVisor: [Prof. Wenxiong Kang](https://yanzhao.scut.edu.cn/open/ExpertInfo.aspx?zjbh=uEEiNVSAKPm0dfrODLtrzQ== "Prof. Wenxiong Kang"){:target="_blank"} (IEEE fellow)

To study further, I actively applied an intern of my school's lab. In the first four months, I mainly learn the fundamental of ML and DL. After that, I began to read and reproduce top papers in the field of Gait Recognition and Knowledge Distillation. To gain more knowledge, I also finished [MIT 6.5940:Efficient ML](https://efficientml.ai "MIT 6.5940"). And now, I am working on a project collaborating with Prof. Wenxiong Kang, aiming to make models in gait recognition more efficient. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested. 

## 2. National University of Singapore

07/2023, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Program \
Supervisor: [Lect. Prabhu Natarajan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/prabhu/ "Lect. Prabhu Natarajan"){:target="_blank"}

Curious about machine learning and AI, I went to the *National University of Singapore(NUS)* last summer to participate in a project on machine learning. And we mainly focusing on ML algorithms in the sklearn library, such as Random Forest, Decision Tree. Also, we learns two vision patterns, Local Binary Pattern(LBP) and HOG. Eventually, I got a *Distinction* grade in the final presentation.
