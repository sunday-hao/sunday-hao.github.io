# Research Experience

## 1. Intern at Biometrics and Intelligence Perception Lab

SuperVisor: [Prof. Wenxiong Kang](https://yanzhao.scut.edu.cn/open/ExpertInfo.aspx?zjbh=uEEiNVSAKPm0dfrODLtrzQ== "Prof. Wenxiong Kang"){:target="_blank"} (IEEE fellow)

09/2023 - Present, SCUT

In the first four months, I mainly learn the fundamental of ML and DL. After that, I began to read and reproduce top papers in the field of Gait Recognition and Knowledge Distillation. To gain more knowledge, I finished [MIT 6.5940](https://efficientml.ai "MIT 6.5940") last month. And now, I am working on a project collaborating with Prof. Wenxiong Kang, aiming to make models in gait recognition more efficient. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested. 
## 2. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Program

*Summer School, NUS*

Supervisor: [Lect. Prabhu Natarajan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/prabhu/ "Lect. Prabhu Natarajan"){:target="_blank"}

07/2023, NUS

In this program, we mainly focusing on ML algorithms in the sklearn library, such as Random Forest, Decision Tree. Also, we learns two vision patterns, Local Binary Pattern(LBP) and HOG. Eventually, I got a *Distinction* grade in the final presentation.
