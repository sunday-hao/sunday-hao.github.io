# Research Experience

## 1. Intern at Biometrics and Intelligence Perception Lab

SuperVisor: [Prof. Wenxiong Kang](https://yanzhao.scut.edu.cn/open/ExpertInfo.aspx?zjbh=uEEiNVSAKPm0dfrODLtrzQ== "Prof. Wenxiong Kang"){:target="_blank"} (IEEE fellow)

09/2023 - Present

In the first four months, I mainly learn the fundamental of ML and DL. After that, I began to read and reproduce top papers in the field of Gait Recognition. To gain more knowledge, I finished [MIT 6.5940](https://efficientml.ai "MIT 6.5940"). And now, I am working on a project collaborating with Prof. Kang, aiming to accelerate models in gait recognition more efficient.
## 2. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Program

*Summer School at NUS*

Supervisor: [Lect. Prabhu Natarajan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/prabhu/ "Lect. Prabhu Natarajan"){:target="_blank"}

07/2023, NUS

In this program, we mainly focusing on ML algorithms in the sklearn library, such as Random Forest, Decision Tree. Also, we learns two vision patterns, Local Binary Pattern(LBP) and HOG. Eventually, I got a *Distinction* grade in the final presentation.
